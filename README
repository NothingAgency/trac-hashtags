= Trac 1.x plug-in that parses hashtags in text with #<word>. =

The plug-in parses 'hash tagged' words (like in Twitter or Google+)
Whenever user types a word with # e.g. #trac the word is linked and
the word is regarded as tag that is listed on a separate page. In order
to do so the plugin hooks into the existing #[ticket number] parser
without conflicts. Hence the ticket number parser remains working as
usual, but if a word starts after # it is regarded as regular tag.
When users click on the parsed hash tag, all connected tickets with
the same hash tag is listed. So this helps to semantically connect
tickets.
The source-code of the plug-in has been made open-source . It is
published on Nothing Agency GitHub account
(https://github.com/nothingagency) so others can either download the
source-code or contribute to it.

== Dependencies ==

This plugin depends on the following components to be installed:


  - [http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TagsPlugin TracTags]  ,,Since version ''' 0.1.0 ''',, . 
    Plugin is basically a bit like the tagging plug-in but you can add
    tags through the hash parsing instead of having to enter them in a
    separate field. Therefore the functionality of existing tag plug-in
    is extended to support hash-tags additionally. It's possible to
    choose between the 2 modes by enabling / disabling this plugin.
    A migration path is offered where all old Tracs used with the tags
    plug-in the existing tags would be added as hash tag to the ticket
    description and then the tags page would still be available.


== Installation ==

This plugin has been tested with 
[http://trac.edgewall.org/ Trac]  [http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/1.0 1.0] . 

The first step to make it work is to [wiki:TracPlugins install this plugin] 
either for a particular environment or otherwise make it available to
all the environments:

{{{
$ easy_install /path/to/unpacked/TracHashTags-x.y.z.zip
}}}

,, where ''x.y.z'' is the version of the plugin,,

... or alternately ...

{{{
$ easy_install TracHashTags
}}}

In case of having internet connection and access to 
[http://pypi.python.org/pypi PyPI] or a simlar repository, both these 
methods '''should''' automatically retrieve the [#Dependencies external 
dependencies] from there.

== Configuration ==

In order to enable [wiki:/En/Devel/TracHashTags TracHashTags] plugin, 
the only thing to do is to add the following lines to [wiki:TracIni trac.ini].

{{{
